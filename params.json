  "body": "\r\nAWOT provides a toolkit of utilities to read and visualize weather observation files collected via aircraft platforms.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Package Structure \r\n_(Documentation to follow soon!)_\r\n###io\r\nInput and output of specific data files<br><br>\r\nIn-Situ Flight Data:<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;* NetCDF<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;* NASA AMES FFI 1001 format<br>\r\nRemote Sensing:<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;* Univ. Wyoming Cloud Radar (W-band) Level 2 NetCDF files.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;* Univ. of Wyoming Cloud Lidar.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;* NOAA P-3/G-IV tail Doppler and lower fuselage radar native radar coordinates.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;* NOAA P-3 tail Doppler and lower fuselage radar gridded coordinates produced by the windysn program.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;* LATMOS/SAFIRE Falcon NetCDF files which contain both W-band radar and flight information.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;* Any surface-based radar file readable with Py-ART.\r\n\r\n###graph\r\nProduce horizontal or vertical plots.  Horizontal plots are overlaid on a Basemap instance and vertical plots are regular 2D plots. Experimental 3D plotting is also provided.\r\n\r\n###utility\r\nRoutines for matching flight track to points in a volume of data, creating radar CFAD diagrams. In addition, a number of helper/conversion routines can be found here.\r\n\r\n###src\r\nProcessing software for NOAA P-3 tail radar data. Work in progress, not operational yet.\r\n\r\n## How-to\r\nMany [examples](https://github.com/nguy/AWOT/tree/master/examples) Jupyter notebooks are provided to familiarize yourself with AWOT.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nThe latest source code for AWOT can be obtained from the GitHub repository,\r\n[https://github.com/nguy/AWOT](https://github.com/nguy/AWOT).\r\n\r\nEither download and unpack the zip file of the source code or use git to checkout the repository\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/nguy/AWOT\r\n```\r\nTo install in your home directory, use:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython setup.py install --user\r\n```\r\nTo install for all users on Unix/Linux:\r\n```\r\npython setup.py build\r\nsudo python setup.py install\r\n```\r\nDependencies are listed in the README at the [code repository](https://github.com/nguy/AWOT)\r\n\r\nAWOT is developed on MacOSX 10.9 - 10.10.5 using Python 2.7, though it _should_ be Python 3 compliant.\r\n\r\n##Contributors\r\n[Nick Guy](https://github.com/nguy)<br>\r\nTimothy Lang<br>\r\nAndrew Lyons",
