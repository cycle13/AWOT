===============

AWOT is a toolkit of utilities to read in and visualize weather
observations taken by aircraft.

## Installation
The latest source code for AWOT can be obtained from the GitHub repository,
[https://github.com/nguy/AWOT](https://github.com/nguy/AWOT).

Either download and unpack the zip file of the source code or use git to checkout the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/nguy/AWOT
```
To install in your home directory, use:

```
python setup.py install --user
```
To install for all users on Unix/Linux:
```
python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install
```

## Structure
This package is currently divided as follows:

###io - Input and output of specific data files
Flight Data:
	 NetCDF files
	 NASA AMES FFI 1001 format

Radar:
	 Univ. Wyoming Cloud Radar (W-band) Level 2 NetCDF files.
	 Univ. of Wyoming Cloud Lidar.
	 NOAA P-3/G-IV tail Doppler and lower fuselage radar native radar coordinates.
 	 NOAA P-3 tail Doppler and lower fuselage radar gridded coordinates produced by the windysn program.
	 LATMOS/SAFIRE Falcon NetCDF files which contain both W-band radar and flight information.

###graph - Produces plots.  Horizontal plots are overlaid on a basemap instance
and vertical plots are regular 2D plots.

###display - Very immature visualization routines.  Work is in progress.

###src - Processing software for NOAA P-3 tail radar data.

## Usage
See the [examples](https://github.com/nguy/AWOT/tree/master/examples) directory for a number of notebooks.

Read a NOAA P-3 tail radar sweep file:

```
from awot import io
radar = io.read_tdr_sweep(fname='p3_radar_file.nc')
```

Read a flight data file in NetCDF:
```
from awot import io
flight = io.read_netcdf(fname='flightfile.nc', platform='p-3', file_format='netcdf')
```

Read a binary windsyn file:
```
from awot import io

radar = io.read_windsyn_binary(filename=file, platform='p-3', file_format='netcdf', instrument='tdr_sweep')
```

Data can then be plotted:
```python
from awot import graph

rgp = graph.RadarSweepPlot(fl, instrument='tdr_sweep')

rgp.plot_track_relative('dBZ')

from awot import graph

flp = FlightLevel(flight)

flp.plot_trackmap(color_by_altitude=True, track_cmap='spectral', addlegend=True, addtitle=True)
```

## Dependencies

A typical scientific python stack is employed:
    [Numpy](http://www.scipy.org)
    [Scipy](http://www.scipy.org)
    [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org)
    [netCDF4](http://code.google.com/p/netcdf4-python)

It is highly recommended to use [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) python
distribution that provides easy access to all of these packages along with much more.

Optional:
    [Py-ART](https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart) package is used for reading some radar data.
    [Simplekml](http://www.simplekml.com) used to produce KMZ file output.




## Notes
At present this package is primarily for visualization.  However, work is underway to connect
many processing routines that allow processing from start to finish with airborne data.

Development to provide the ability to process Wyoming Cloud radar and lidar files is underway.

AWOT was developed on MacOSX 10.9 - 10.10.5 using Python 2.7, though it should be Python 3 compliant.
